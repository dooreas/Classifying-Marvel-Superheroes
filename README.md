This project was done for the subject of Image and Vision Computing that I took in my MSc in AI. I have not organized yet these files but in the pdf document a brief description of hat each documents does is given (sorry for the file names:)). The project was based on training, validating and improving two models for image classification. One based on feature engineering with BoW and the SIFT detector plus SVMs. The other was Resnet18. A comparison of their robustness to typical image alterations was done.
